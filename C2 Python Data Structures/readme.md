**About this Course**

This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  This course covers Python 3.

**WHAT YOU WILL LEARN**
* Explain the principles of data structures & how they are used
* Create programs that are able to read and write data from files
* Store data as key/value pairs using Python dictionaries
* Accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping using tuples

**SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN**
* Python Syntax And Semantics
* Data Structure
* Tuple
* Python Programming
